An n x n matrix is valid if every row and every column contains all the integers from 1 to n (inclusive)

Given an n x n integer matrix, return true if the matrix is valid. Otherwise, return false.

Example 1:

* Input: matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1], [3, 1, 2]]
*
* Output = true
*
* In this case, n = 3, and every row and column contains the numbers 1, 2, and 3.
*
* Hence, we return true
